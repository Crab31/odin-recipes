# odin-recipes

This is my first actual project from TOP, in which i will make an HTML recipe website. This website wont have css and javascript till later however, i will be using all of the things i have learned in previous lessons in order to build this website, link it to other webpages that show recipes. this is like a directory website! 

This is really exciting for me to do and i will do my best to code from memory and I will come back at the end to type what i've learned!

:D

This is me coming back after finishing my project to describe things ive learnt and how the project went.
While their wasn't anything particualry new i learned I was able to create the index.html page and the following 3 website pages from memory. Which is something im very happy i was able to do. and I was even able to come back and write my experience and commit this change to my github repo from memory as well. I am now learning the basics of CSS and soon javascript and will begin to write commit meassages and add notes throughout my code so that i am better able to learn as i go along.
