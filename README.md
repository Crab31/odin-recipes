# odin-recipes

This is my first actual project from TOP, in which i will make an HTML recipe website. This website wont have css and javascript till later however, i will be using all of the things i have learned in previous lessons in order to build this website, link it to other webpages that show recipes. this is like a directory website! 

This is really exciting for me to do and i will do my best to code from memory and I will come back at the end to type what i've learned!

:D
